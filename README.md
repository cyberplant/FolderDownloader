It's an easy folder downloader for Dropbox.

If you need to download some files/folders from your Dropbox 
and you don't want to setup your account (like when you are
using a shared environment), then this tool is for you.

the application. You will see:

    Please visit this website and press the 'Allow' button, 
    then hit 'Enter' here:

Open this URL with a browser and press "Allow".

After that go back to the app and press 'enter'. It will
download to your machine all that you have in the folder
"Apps/FolderDownloader" of your Dropbox account.
